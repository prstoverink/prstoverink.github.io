						<h3>About Us</h3>
						<p>When I was 4 years old, my birthday party was "wedding" themed. As messed up as this could be construed (thanks Mom!), it was everything I wanted and started me on a path. Until my little sister was born in 2000, I would
							tell people that my second cousin's wedding in Baltimore was the best day of my life (after my sister was born, that and the other wedding I attended tied for second place). I have always loved weddings. I love love. I
							love the commitment, the romance, and most of all the happy endings. Your wedding is the start of that happy ending and I can imagine no other business that I would want to be a part of more than one that celebrates that.
							That is my passion. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-6 col-12-narrow">
						<p>And my skillset aligns just as neatly. Just over a year after I finished my undergraduate degree, I decided to go back to school and peruse a master’s degree in business. I recognized that I’ve been planning detailed
							fantasies for as long as I could remember and very few people had Excel budgets at 15. This started me on a path down what was essentially project management. While I loved the planning and the budgeting of project
							management within a corporate structure, the topic was of very little interest. Which led me to molding my two passions into something so perfect I had no choice but to pursue it. Because what is wedding planning if not
							project management? There is no better marriage for my type A obsessive personality and my bubbly love of love then the industry of marriage.</p>
